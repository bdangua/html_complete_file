    <h2>My younger Brothers</h2>
    <p>His name is sonu. I still remember the day he was born, so small, so sweet, just like a bundle of soft cotton. He used to cry all the time and sometimes I could not even sleep.

        After some time he started smiling at me and touching me. I liked him doing that. Then, when he became a little more old, he started playing with me. First I liked playing with him, but then when he started taking away all my toys, I used to get angry. I still remember how we used to fight over small toys, pulling each other, hitting and then snatching and running away…</p>

         <p>Since our age gap is very less, we were always fighting. To the extent he would watch wwe and try all the pedigree and stunts on me. Well it isn't as horrifying as it sounds. I tried my best to put up with him but alas he would win most of the time. For us winning was who would have a last say in fight aka who would punch or beat the other at last. One time, I guess I was 9-10 years old</p>

         <p>Kisama is a village on AH2 highway from Kohima to Imphal, about 10 kilometer south from Kohima, capital of Nagaland state of India. It is famous for "Hornbill festival" which is held from 1 to 10 December every year. From NEC point of Kohima during this festival, taxi fare is 50 rupees per person. This village is located on the slope of a hill about 5400 feet high. There are some permanent residents here but during this festival many people from various part gather here and all the boarding places become full. Some permanent and some makeshift shops and huts are there each representing a local tribe. Some pavillions are for fruits, plants, flowers, orhids and handicrafts of Nagalands. Each tribe's huts also serves their special foods too. There is a stadium where main cultural show of various tribes continues throughout the day upto 10 pm. It is a lifetime experience for me no doubt. I think it is a daylong activity, so one should stay overnight here though boearding facility is very poor.</p>
